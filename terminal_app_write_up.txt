While thinking about the design for this terminal application, and as to what direction i would like the design and implementation to head, I found myself thinking about what i wanted to get from the process of the constructing the terminal app and also, on what i enjoyed, and within that , what i could do to enjoy the process more and to further educate myself and others on a topic that i enjoyed and also had some previous knowledge on. 
The application that i decided to design, will be a basketball-type, will help to solve a problem many basketball enthusiasts encounter, what were the statistics of a particular player , during a particular season. Aimed primarily for basketball enthusiasts , who are after some quick, specific basketball data. Providing a menu guided and user input application, this will provide this exactly. Firstly, the app will prompt the user for their name. Upon receiving this, the app will greet the user with their name (using string interpolation and user input data). After this, the app will then prompt the user to pick their favorite basketball player from a list provided (which will be displayed in a terminal table, gathered from a Ruby Gem). These players represent the best and most popular players that the National Basketball Association (NBA), has to offer. The application will then provide the user with statistics from the selected player, from the 2018-2019 season. The statistics that will be provided will be points, rebounds, assists, and games played for that particular season. This information will be gathered from a CSV file , which has been required in the Ruby documentation. The CSV file itself, was hard-coded into google sheets , exported as a CSV file and required through the Ruby documentation. After the selection and statistical information has been provided, the application will give some small antedotes about the player/nicknames that are used in the media and are commonly known around basketball circles. Following this, the user is again prompted to ask some questions regarding how they think they would fare in the NBA themselves. With each iteration of a question, regarding points,rebounds, assists, and games played (statistics found in the source information) the application will use flow control and methods/functions to retrieve the data and display through string interpolation, once again, what kind of player they themselves would be. For visual purposes, used is several gems to make certain criteria of the application more visably aesthetic to the user. Questions would be coloured differently to normal text using a Ruby Gem. The same Gem also made any mistakes that user had encountered coloured red. The application uses an 'Artii' Ruby Gem to place a lasting effect upon the user. The user will use the application by the guided menu and interaction themselves, resulting in a outcome of them picking their favorite player and getting placed on the table , only to be 'removed' later. 






Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .
